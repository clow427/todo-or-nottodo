# Todo or NotTodo App

This is a simple and modern Todo List app built with Expo and React Native. It helps you organize your tasks, set due dates, and color-code your todos for better productivity.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a description, due date, and color category (blue, yellow, or red)
- Edit or delete existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Sort tasks by due date (ascending or descending)
- Color-code tasks for easy visual organization

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task**: Use the input at the top to type your task, pick a color, and optionally set a due date. Press **Add** to save it.
2. **Edit a Task**: Tap the edit icon on any task to change its text, color, or due date. Save or cancel your changes.
3. **Complete a Task**: Tap the checkbox to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
4. **Delete a Task**: Tap the delete icon to remove a task from your list.
5. **Sort Tasks**: Use the arrow button next to the due date input to toggle sorting by due date (ascending/descending).

All your tasks are managed locally on your device.
